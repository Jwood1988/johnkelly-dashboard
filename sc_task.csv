Responsibility assumed is per this email upon inquiry that I wouldnt know. Okay, the Oracle Instance is NAERPCVS and I’m not sure if he needs an exact access, he just needs to be able to approve Oracle workflow notifications. 
Either let them know that or just tell them Accounts Payable Inquiry – COL as the responsibility name. 

They might need to give him a Meritor 611 ID though to be able to do it. 
I’m not sure how that is working these days.

Taylor does not have a prd domain ID which is needed for oracle. that needs to be created at the site. 
Because you don't have a PRD domain ID. Unless you are an long time existing  cummins user who suddenly needs access to the Meritor network, your ID needs to be created at your site. 
I think we have had a few of Mr. Browns people with the same issue. I have to close out that ticket but I can open a new one for you once you have your PRD domain ID. 

Let me know.

Barbara,

We don't do access requests for GIEA at this desk. I believe he needs to submit this request: Application Access Request - Answers

Under ""Select Application,"" he can search for GIEA or Oracle and should find the application he is looking to access.

Hi Barbara,

One of you workers submitted a ticket for access to AFT-APS/ASCP - Meritor 12.2.4. The user is Robert Pecorani. He doesn't appear to be in the Meritor system. I'm thinking he requested the wrong application. Do you happen to know what he is requesting so I can get the ticket to the right group?

Hi Maria,

While processing your Oracle Access request, I ran into an error. Edson Gianiselle is still listed as your manager, but that person is disabled. Your current manager will need to contact HR to have his information updated in PeopleSoft to show as your manager. Once that is done, we will be able to process your request.

Thanks!

Hi Amy,

Thank you for your quick response.

For the Oracle Instance, that is the specific instance of Oracle you connect to. There are multiple instances throughout the system. If you don't know which one you connect to, you can ask your manager or a co-worker who also uses it. You could also send me the URL you connect to and I can figure it out from there.

For the Requested Responsibilities, we need to know what jobs to assign you in Oracle. Again, you can consult with your manager or a co-worker as to what those would be. If you still are unsure, you could give me the ID of another user who has the same access you need and I can mirror your account off of theirs.

Thanks!

Subject: SCTASK2551829 | Oracle Access Request for Kristin Zydor

Hi Willie,

To process a Meritor Oracle access request for Kristin, she must first have a Meritor ID. I do not see her in active directory. If she does have a Meritor ID, please let me know what it is. If she does not, please follow the attached instructions to request one. Once she has a Meritor ID, we can process her Oracle request.

Thanks!

sorry I don't understand what you are asking for. Oracle needs no install. it is web based. If you are looking for access to oracle you need to fill out the oracle form and send it in. I will email this to you as well.



Oracle Access Requests: Step-by-Step Process

Step 1: Capture Information from the User Using the Template

Before proceeding with any Oracle access request, gather all required details from the user using the following template:

•	New Oracle Account: Yes/No
•	Update Existing Account: Yes/No
•	Oracle Instance: (e.g., NAERPPRD or URL)
•	Site / Location: (Specify site)
•	Requester: (The person making the request)
•	For User: (User needing access)
•	If Replacing Another User: Follow up with the manager or IS Site lead to remove unnecessary responsibilities for the replaced user.
•	Job Re-scoping: Ensure outdated responsibilities are removed.
•	Title/Position:
•	Oracle ID: (Employee ID, e.g., 611)
•	Supervisor/Manager: (As listed in PeopleSoft)
•	Requested Responsibilities: Exact names of the responsibilities (e.g., ""AP VIEW ONLY INQUIRY - LIN,"" not ""AP for LIN"")
•	Responsibility End Date: Either ""No End Date"" or ""DD-MMM-YYYY""
•	Justification: Be specific about why the user needs these responsibilities (Do NOT just state, ""Needed to perform my job"").

For all oracle access we need the user to have a PRD domain account and we need to have the oracle access template filled out for each user. I do not see PRD domain accounts for all of the users in your list and they cant use oracle until they have one. I also need the template filled out for each and every person. The form includes the users PRD domain name, we need that included. I do see a few that have a prd domain account and that is Sobrinho, Edenildo J with a PRD domain ID of PRD\sobrinej. You have included their Cummins network ID but since oracle runs on the PRD domain still, we need their PRD ID's instead.

So you will need to get all of the users below who do not have a PRD domain ID eRamped so they have a PRD domain ID and then fill out the form for each and every user. Please let me know if you have any questions.



Step 1: Capture Information from the User Using the Template

Before proceeding with any Oracle access request, gather all required details from the user using the following template:

•	New Oracle Account: Yes/No
•	Update Existing Account: Yes/No
•	Oracle Instance: (e.g., NAERPPRD or URL)
•	Site / Location: (Specify site)
•	Requester: (The person making the request)
•	For User: (User needing access)
•	If Replacing Another User: Follow up with the manager or IS Site lead to remove unnecessary responsibilities for the replaced user.
•	Job Re-scoping: Ensure outdated responsibilities are removed.
•	Title/Position:
•	Oracle ID: (Employee ID, e.g., PRD\611)
•	Supervisor/Manager: (As listed in PeopleSoft)
•	Requested Responsibilities: Exact names of the responsibilities (e.g., ""AP VIEW ONLY INQUIRY - LIN,"" not ""AP for LIN"")
•	Responsibility End Date: Either ""No End Date"" or ""DD-MMM-YYYY""
•	Justification: Be specific about why the user needs these responsibilities (Do NOT just state, ""Needed to perform my job"").

Subject: I can not complete ticket SCTASK2604155

For all oracle access we need the user to have a PRD domain account and we need to have the oracle access template filled out for each user. I do not see PRD domain accounts for all of the users in your list and they cant use oracle until they have one. I also need the template filled out for each and every person. The form includes the users PRD domain name, we need that included. I do see a few that have a prd domain account and that is Sobrinho, Edenildo J with a PRD domain ID of PRD\sobrinej. You have included their Cummins network ID but since oracle runs on the PRD domain still, we need their PRD ID's instead.

So you will need to get all of the users below who do not have a PRD domain ID eRamped so they have a PRD domain ID and then fill out the form for each and every user. Please let me know if you have any questions.



Step 1: Capture Information from the User Using the Template

Before proceeding with any Oracle access request, gather all required details from the user using the following template:

•	New Oracle Account: Yes/No
•	Update Existing Account: Yes/No
•	Oracle Instance: (e.g., NAERPPRD or URL)
•	Site / Location: (Specify site)
•	Requester: (The person making the request)
•	For User: (User needing access)
•	If Replacing Another User: Follow up with the manager or IS Site lead to remove unnecessary responsibilities for the replaced user.
•	Job Re-scoping: Ensure outdated responsibilities are removed.
•	Title/Position:
•	Oracle ID: (Employee ID, e.g., PRD\611)
•	Supervisor/Manager: (As listed in PeopleSoft)
•	Requested Responsibilities: Exact names of the responsibilities (e.g., ""AP VIEW ONLY INQUIRY - LIN,"" not ""AP for LIN"")
•	Responsibility End Date: Either ""No End Date"" or ""DD-MMM-YYYY""
•	Justification: Be specific about why the user needs these responsibilities (Do NOT just state, ""Needed to perform my job"").

We need more information than just User needs access. We need the access form filled out and returned before we can get you any access to oracle. If there is a user with oracle responsibilities you need please let me know the users name and I can get you a copy of all the users oracle responsibilities.

Subject: I have no way to mimic other peoples permissions on the servers

The users would need to go to the IAM web site, log in with their Meritor IDs and then request the access one server at a time by name I believe. Below is a link to the web site. According to James Kinney,  Darryl helps to manage the service and I have him CCed if you have any issues. 

With our security this is the only way we have to get you admin access to servers. I cant do it for you by copying an account.

How to Fix It
The address may be misspelled or may not exist. Try one or more of the following:
•	Send the message again following these steps: In Outlook, open this non-delivery report (NDR) and choose Send Again from the Report ribbon. In Outlook on the web, select this NDR, then select the link ""To send this message again, click here."" Then delete and retype the entire recipient address. If prompted with an Auto-Complete List suggestion don't select it. After typing the complete address, click Send.
•	Contact the recipient (by phone, for example) to check that the address exists and is correct.
•	The recipient may have set up email forwarding to an incorrect address. Ask them to check that any forwarding they've set up is working correctly.
•	Clear the recipient Auto-Complete List in Outlook or Outlook on the web by following the steps in this article: Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365, and then send the message again. Retype the entire recipient address before selecting Send.

________________________________________

More Info for Email Admins
Status code: 550 5.1.10 

This error occurs because the sender sent a message to an email address hosted by Office 365 but the address is incorrect or doesn't exist at the destination domain. The error is reported by the recipient domain's email server, but most often it must be fixed by the person who sent the message. If the steps in the How to Fix It section above don't fix the problem, and you're the email admin for the recipient, try one or more of the following:

The email address exists and is correct - Confirm that the recipient address exists, is correct, and is accepting messages.

Synchronize your directories - If you have a hybrid environment and are using directory synchronization make sure the recipient's email address is synced correctly in both Office 365 and in your on-premises directory.

Errant forwarding rule - Check for forwarding rules that aren't behaving as expected. Forwarding can be set up by an admin via mail flow rules or mailbox forwarding address settings, or by the recipient via the Inbox Rules feature.

Recipient has a valid license - Make sure the recipient has an Office 365 license assigned to them. The recipient's email admin can use the Office 365 admin center to assign a license (Users > Active Users > select the recipient > Assigned License > Edit).

Mail flow settings and MX records are not correct - Misconfigured mail flow or MX record settings can cause this error. Check your Office 365 mail flow settings to make sure your domain and any mail flow connectors are set up correctly. Also, work with your domain registrar to make sure the MX records for your domain are configured correctly.

For more information and additional tips to fix this issue, see Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365.

How to Fix It
The address may be misspelled or may not exist. Try one or more of the following:
•	Send the message again following these steps: In Outlook, open this non-delivery report (NDR) and choose Send Again from the Report ribbon. In Outlook on the web, select this NDR, then select the link ""To send this message again, click here."" Then delete and retype the entire recipient address. If prompted with an Auto-Complete List suggestion don't select it. After typing the complete address, click Send.
•	Contact the recipient (by phone, for example) to check that the address exists and is correct.
•	The recipient may have set up email forwarding to an incorrect address. Ask them to check that any forwarding they've set up is working correctly.
•	Clear the recipient Auto-Complete List in Outlook or Outlook on the web by following the steps in this article: Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365, and then send the message again. Retype the entire recipient address before selecting Send.

More Info for Email Admins
Status code: 550 5.1.10 

This error occurs because the sender sent a message to an email address hosted by Office 365 but the address is incorrect or doesn't exist at the destination domain. The error is reported by the recipient domain's email server, but most often it must be fixed by the person who sent the message. If the steps in the How to Fix It section above don't fix the problem, and you're the email admin for the recipient, try one or more of the following:

The email address exists and is correct - Confirm that the recipient address exists, is correct, and is accepting messages.

Synchronize your directories - If you have a hybrid environment and are using directory synchronization make sure the recipient's email address is synced correctly in both Office 365 and in your on-premises directory.

Errant forwarding rule - Check for forwarding rules that aren't behaving as expected. Forwarding can be set up by an admin via mail flow rules or mailbox forwarding address settings, or by the recipient via the Inbox Rules feature.

Recipient has a valid license - Make sure the recipient has an Office 365 license assigned to them. The recipient's email admin can use the Office 365 admin center to assign a license (Users > Active Users > select the recipient > Assigned License > Edit).

Mail flow settings and MX records are not correct - Misconfigured mail flow or MX record settings can cause this error. Check your Office 365 mail flow settings to make sure your domain and any mail flow connectors are set up correctly. Also, work with your domain registrar to make sure the MX records for your domain are configured correctly.

Hi Diamond,

A Clear Orbit access request is done the same as an Oracle access request. Therefor, we will need the appropriate specific ""responsibilities"" you'll need added. If you're not sure what they should be, please consult with your manager or a colleague who already has this access.

Thanks!

Hi Donald,

I sent a file yesterday to Evan for everyone that was put in for clear orbit request. I will attach the same file to this email, please let me know if you have any questions.

•	New Oracle Account: Yes
•	Update Existing Account: No
•	Oracle Instance: 
•	Site / Location: York, SC
•	Requester: Diamond Eason
•	For User: Diamond Eason needing access to clear orbit-Meritor
•	If Replacing Another User: N/A
•	Job Re-scoping: N/A
•	Title/Position: Business Unit Supervisor 
•	Oracle ID: UV646
•	Supervisor/Manager: Michael Hannon

For any change in oracle access the form has to be filled out for the auditors. We will need you to list the responsibilities that are needed. Need access to payout is not a responsibility.
If you need the same access as someone else let me know who that is and I can run a report on that person, and get you a list of their responsibilities so you can add them to the form.

Your users PRD domain account that oracle uses is disabled. So I cant process this request. I cant even email Ola Nygren as she does not have an email address.

 

It seems to me there are account issues that need to be fixed before we can get her oracle access. Your IS folks need to get her a working PRD domain account for oracle.

we need the oracle access form filled out. I will email this to you as well. The description does not tell me what oracle instance you are asking for access to. Please fill out the form and return it to me. We also need the full name of the needed responsibilities needed. 


Step 1: Capture Information from the User Using the Template

Before proceeding with any Oracle access request, gather all required details from the user using the following template:

•	New Oracle Account: Yes/No
•	Update Existing Account: Yes/No
•	Oracle Instance: (e.g., NAERPPRD or URL)
•	Site / Location: (Specify site)
•	Requester: (The person making the request)
•	For User: (User needing access)
•	If Replacing Another User: Follow up with the manager or IS Site lead to remove unnecessary responsibilities for the replaced user.
•	Job Re-scoping: Ensure outdated responsibilities are removed.
•	Title/Position:
•	Oracle ID: (Employee ID, e.g., 611)
•	Supervisor/Manager: (As listed in PeopleSoft)
•	Requested Responsibilities: Exact names of the responsibilities (e.g., ""AP VIEW ONLY INQUIRY - LIN,"" not ""AP for LIN"")
•	Responsibility End Date: Either ""No End Date"" or ""DD-MMM-YYYY""
•	Justification: Be specific about why the user needs these responsibilities (Do NOT just state, ""Needed to perform my job"").

I am sorry I don't understand your ticket. It says you want access to a shared drive and to windchill, which is it? Is it both?

Do you have a prd domain ID? Have you already requested one and have it or do you need one created?

I never heard back from the user on filling out the form

the user was emailed again about filling out the form.

01-22-2025 10:03:58 - Jon Schoonfield (Additional comments)
anyone requesting oracle access has to fill out the Meritor oracle access request form.  Please let me know if you need any help filling it out. 
I will email you this as well sir.


Step 1: Capture Information from the User Using the Template

Before proceeding with any Oracle access request, gather all required details from the user using the following template:

•	New Oracle Account: Yes/No
•	Update Existing Account: Yes/No
•	Oracle Instance: (e.g., NAERPPRD or URL)
•	Site / Location: (Specify site)
•	Requester: (The person making the request)
•	For User: (User needing access)
•	If Replacing Another User: Follow up with the manager or IS Site lead to remove unnecessary responsibilities for the replaced user.
•	Job Re-scoping: Ensure outdated responsibilities are removed.
•	Title/Position:
•	Oracle ID: (Employee ID, e.g., 611) - it looks like yours is ferna1ap
•	Supervisor/Manager: (As listed in PeopleSoft)
•	Requested Responsibilities: Exact names of the responsibilities (e.g., ""AP VIEW ONLY INQUIRY - LIN,"" not ""AP for LIN"")
•	Responsibility End Date: Either ""No End Date"" or ""DD-MMM-YYYY""
•	Justification: Be specific about why the user needs these responsibilities (Do NOT just state, ""Needed to perform my job"").

I never heard back from the user on filling out the form

01-23-2025 10:50:42 - Jon Schoonfield (Additional comments)
the user was emailed again about filling out the form.

01-22-2025 10:03:58 - Jon Schoonfield (Additional comments)
anyone requesting oracle access has to fill out the Meritor oracle access request form.  Please let me know if you need any help filling it out. 
I will email you this as well sir.


Step 1: Capture Information from the User Using the Template

Before proceeding with any Oracle access request, gather all required details from the user using the following template:

•	New Oracle Account: Yes/No
•	Update Existing Account: Yes/No
•	Oracle Instance: (e.g., NAERPPRD or URL)
•	Site / Location: (Specify site)
•	Requester: (The person making the request)
•	For User: (User needing access)
•	If Replacing Another User: Follow up with the manager or IS Site lead to remove unnecessary responsibilities for the replaced user.
•	Job Re-scoping: Ensure outdated responsibilities are removed.
•	Title/Position:
•	Oracle ID: (Employee ID, e.g., 611) - it looks like yours is ferna1ap
•	Supervisor/Manager: (As listed in PeopleSoft)
•	Requested Responsibilities: Exact names of the responsibilities (e.g., ""AP VIEW ONLY INQUIRY - LIN,"" not ""AP for LIN"")
•	Responsibility End Date: Either ""No End Date"" or ""DD-MMM-YYYY""
•	Justification: Be specific about why the user needs these responsibilities (Do NOT just state, ""Needed to perform my job"").

I added your PRD account to the folder which is all I can do. Cummins does not seem to be syncing changes to active directory groups from the old Meritor PRD domain. You need to wait 30 minutes and then reboot your PC and see if you can access the folder. If you cant, you will have to map the drive as your PRD account in order for it to open.


To map the drive as your PRD account you would need to go to My computer  - computer – map network drive

 



Then you want to map it as your Meritor PRD domain account. Use the test  \\cifs.meritor.com\share in the folder spot. Check the reconnect and the connect using different credintials check boxes

 


Then log in like below with your PRD domain user name. 

 


If you have any issues please email me or call me in teams and I can map it for you.

Hello,

Need an account to be created for SFTP file transfer in the ftp-external.meritor.com, username TESTOCIsaPenske to get files transferred from Penske
ftp-external.meritor.com is an existing external ftp server used by CDBS CVS-Warranty team to get the files from OEM's
We would like to add a new user for the same external ftp server for the OEM Penske so that they can send files via SFTP.

Let me know if you have any questions we can have a call to discuss further if needed.

Hello,

Need an account to be created for SFTP file transfer in the ftp-external.meritor.com, username TESTOCIsaPenske to get files transferred from Penske
ftp-external.meritor.com is an existing external ftp server used by CDBS CVS-Warranty team to get the files from OEM's
We would like to add a new user for the same external ftp server for the OEM Penske so that they can send files via SFTP.

Let me know if you have any questions we can have a call to discuss further if needed.

you need to fill out the oracle access form below. I will email it to you as well.


Step 1: Capture Information from the User Using the Template

Before proceeding with any Oracle access request, gather all required details from the user using the following template:

•	New Oracle Account: Yes/No
•	Update Existing Account: Yes/No
•	Oracle Instance: (e.g., NAERPPRD or URL)
•	Site / Location: (Specify site)
•	Requester: (The person making the request)
•	For User: (User needing access)
•	If Replacing Another User: Follow up with the manager or IS Site lead to remove unnecessary responsibilities for the replaced user.
•	Job Re-scoping: Ensure outdated responsibilities are removed.
•	Title/Position:
•	Oracle ID: (Employee ID, e.g., 611)
•	Supervisor/Manager: (As listed in PeopleSoft)
•	Requested Responsibilities: Exact names of the responsibilities (e.g., ""AP VIEW ONLY INQUIRY - LIN,"" not ""AP for LIN"")
•	Responsibility End Date: Either ""No End Date"" or ""DD-MMM-YYYY""
•	Justification: Be specific about why the user needs these responsibilities (Do NOT just state, ""Needed to perform my job"").

Subject: The responsibility you are asking for does not appear to exist

I emailed the user the text below yesterday. I still have not heard back. 

Sorry I don't understand the ticket. It looks like you need access to view the files on An ESA shared drive called \\esafs001\Share
Looking at active directory I see you have a PRD domain account with access to that share. Are you having issues mapping it?

I would think you would need to map that share with your PRD domain account for it to be accessible on your cummins PC. Please let me know if you have a few minutes and we can try to map it for you on your cummins PC.

Please guide user on how to request the ZPA from Answers. 

If a user needs ZPA, they should get ZPA installed via the software shelf in Answers.
Attached is an instruction which could be sent to any Cummins user asking for Zscaler.
When they request Zscaler it follows an approval process after which it is automatically installed.

We cant create an account in oracle without an oracle access request form being filled out. We cant just copy other people's access as it is not allowed. Please request what is needed. I will email this to you as well. Any user requesting access to PRD domain oracle would also need a PRD domain account to get access. Does the user requesting access have a PRD domain ID? I would need that as well to provision the account. 


Step 1: Capture Information from the User Using the Template

Before proceeding with any Oracle access request, gather all required details from the user using the following template:

•            New Oracle Account: Yes/No
•            Update Existing Account: Yes/No
•            Oracle Instance: (e.g., NAERPPRD or URL)
•            Site / Location: (Specify site)
•            Requester: (The person making the request)
•            For User: (User needing access)
•            If Replacing Another User: Follow up with the manager or IS Site lead to remove unnecessary responsibilities for the replaced user.
•            Job Re-scoping: Ensure outdated responsibilities are removed.
•            Title/Position:
•            Oracle ID: (Employee ID, e.g., 611)
•            Supervisor/Manager: (As listed in PeopleSoft)
•            Requested Responsibilities: Exact names of the responsibilities (e.g., ""AP VIEW ONLY INQUIRY - LIN,"" not ""AP for LIN"")
•            Responsibility End Date: Either ""No End Date"" or ""DD-MMM-YYYY""
•            Justification: Be specific about why the user needs these responsibilities (Do NOT just state, ""Needed to perform my job"").

before we can get you access to anything oracle we need the oracle request form filled out. from your ticket I cant even tell which on e of the oracle instances you are requesting access to. you also need a prd domain ID. I am not seeing one for you.

•	Site / Location: (Specify site)
•	Requester: (The person making the request)

Hi Renan,

We received your ticket, but there is some confusion. For the configuration item section, it says you are requesting access to Informatica – CDBS. But in the description section, it says you are requesting Oracle access. Please clarify.

If you are requesting Oracle access, please provide the following information:

•	New Oracle Account: Y/N
•	Oracle Instance (ex. NAERPPD, AFTPRD, etc. If unsure, provide the Oracle URL you will be accessing):  
•	Requester: Name
•	For User: Name
•	Title / Position: Job Title
•	Oracle ID: Meritor 611 ID 
•	Supervisor / Manager: Name
•	Requested Responsibilities: Please provide the exact names of the responsibilities. [ex: AP VIEW ONLY INQUIRY - LIN, not ""AP for LIN""]
•	Responsibility End Date:  No End-Date or [By Date DD-MMM-YYYY]
•	Justification: Be specific, do not state, 'Needed to perform my job'.

Thanks!

Email Body: 
This is NOT incorrect. This is the exact location to the Meritor share drive that I am accessing right now using my Meritor PC - I provided a screenshot showing me accessing this. This continues to happen when I get a new PC and this will be my 3rd. Is there someone who is informed about the Meritor integration and the file access we still need today?

Hi Adrian.

 

For access to the CVSWS WH database “MeritorBI_Warranty_DM”, you need to be added to the AD group TRYxBIxWarrantyUdeveloper.  See farther below for current membership.  That will require a ticket created by Answers assigned to the appropriate group.  We don’t maintain AD groups.

 

I don’t know what needs to be done for access to the Warranty Reports in Global Reportal.  It may be the same membership will do the trick, or you’ll need some other.  Snehal or HCL BI Support may know, I’ve ++’d them in.

 

Thanks.
Bob

Good afternoon,

 

I was directed by the Cummins Answers team to talk to you regarding getting access to the CVSWS reports and database so that I can pull reports and import claim/case data into excel spreadsheets.

They told me to check with you for access first, and then to raise the request for Active Directory.

Hi Adrian.

 

For access to the CVSWS WH database “MeritorBI_Warranty_DM”, you need to be added to the AD group TRYxBIxWarrantyUdeveloper.  See farther below for current membership.  That will require a ticket created by Answers assigned to the appropriate group.  We don’t maintain AD groups.

 

I don’t know what needs to be done for access to the Warranty Reports in Global Reportal.  It may be the same membership will do the trick, or you’ll need some other.  Snehal or HCL BI Support may know, I’ve ++’d them in.

 

Thanks.
Bob

An extra information, I use my computer connected at cable for internet. Last time when I unplugged and use the wireless conexion they used to work but now is not.

The same situation happens to any webpage that have Meritor conexion as PDCA, Share point, etc…

Manank K Patel manank.patel@cummins.com is asking for access to the folder path below. That path is allowed for any new user in procurement ( its allow by the default procure group ) so we don't really have an approver on that one. 
He had a PRD domain ID created for access to he finance shares and he is needing Procure as well. Do you approve of the access request?

New Meritor users need to be eramped by HR just like they have always been. The only exception would be for current cummins users who need to get access to an application like windchill or AS400.

It looks like this bounced around for a while before it got to me. What is it you need? Only cummins can make a reservation on their network but to do that they will need the mac address of the pc's network card.
What PC is this for?
Do you want to keep the IP it currently has?


I can gather all the needed info for you. Is this for the new cummins PC in security control?

emailing the user as I dont understand the request. if it is a static IP, cummins has to make that but they are going to need the PC mac address.

It looks like this bounced around for a while before it got to me. What is it you need? Only cummins can make a reservation on their network but to do that they will need the mac address of the pc's network card.
What PC is this for?
Do you want to keep the IP it currently has?


I can gather all the needed info for you. Is this for the new cummins PC in security control?

Aljban,

There are Dell computers that are still on the Meritor network. But to double check, can you go to the computer login screen and instead of typing in your username, type in .\ which should show the computer name. If it is your Meritor computer, it should show up as TRYSINISTAT14. If it says anything different, please let me know.

Thanks!

If you have a cummins laptop you will not be able to connect to bigrig ever. If the site still does not have the cummins enterprise wireless connection available you will have to plug in. I would talk to local support and see if there are other options. There is nothing we can do from Troy to fix it. 

Weird all of the sites in the US already have the cummins enterprise wireless connection.

Hi Team,

I'm from Kronos Team (HCLKronosSupport@cummins.com). Our assignment Group in Service now is CDBS IT - Application Support - Kronos.

1st level of Approval is Attila. We don't have any second level of Approval. Can you please add Suga Priya (vo668) as a group Manager.

2nd Level of approval is Nitin Suvarna, he is part of Peoplesoft team HR apps not Kronos so can you replace his name with Nithin Pillai(nithin.pillai@cummins.com) and add Maxwell Francis (KL748).

This will help us going further for Change Requests or any important approvals. Thanks.

Subject: RITM2812475 - Application Access request: Oracle Global AFT-EBS - CDBS

We need you to fill out the oracle access form below. We need you to answer all of the lines and list the responsibilities that you need. If you have a co worker who has the same access you need please let me know the users name and I can get you a list of all of the responsibilities that, that user has so we can copy them to you. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: We need the oracle request form filled out
Importance: High

We cant do anything until the user fills out the access request form. the user needs to fill it out listing the oracle instances and what responsibilities are needed. If there is another user who has the same responcabilities that you need please give me the users name and I can look up the responsibility for you.

Following the logic that the login script should be creating the drive mappings and that it does so depending on the user's group memberships, if the drive mappings do not get created, follow this guidance to help diagnose the issue:

1)	Was the user in the office or connected to VPN when the login script was triggered?
o	YES -> go to 2)
o	NO -> Connect to VPN and then try again
2)	Can the user manually map a drive to the shared folder?
o	YES -> it is not a permissions issue -> login script issue
Will need to be resolved by working with EUC Technical team to get login script corrected
o	NO -> Go to 3)
3)	Does the user have Cached Credentials for the PRD-domain in Credential Manager?
If so, the user may inadvertently be attempting to connect to the legacy Meritor resources with out-of-date credentials, resulting in no access.
o	YES -> Clear the credentials in credential manager -> then Go to 2)
o	NO -> Go to 4)
4)	Check the Group memberships for the user's WWID to see if it missing any memberships related to the shared folder(s) in question. Then go to 5)
This can easily be done by anyone from any EUC device using the PowerShell samples below. 

To check a user's group memberships related to the groups that belong to a specific SITE…:
(Remember – all legacy Meritor group names should be following the standard naming convention that dictates that the name of a group should start with the site-code of the facility the group belongs to…)

get-adprincipalgroupmembership -identity <wwid> |select name | Where-Object {$_.name -like '<site-code>*' }

               Example:
               get-adprincipalgroupmembership -identity us524 |select name | Where-Object {$_.name -like 'TRY*' }

               Output:
               name
----
TRY - All Users
TRYxeForms-Users
TRYxEbaseUsr
TRY - Dell Deployment Users
TRYWHQUsers
TRYxUsers
TRYxISMgtIncidentN
TRYxMeritorDC

5)	Is the user's WWID missing a group membership it should have that is related to the shared folder(s) in question?
o	YES -> Does the user's Meritor userID have the missing group membership?
?	YES ->   Does the group exist in the Cummins domain and does it have SID-History?
(this can be checked with PowerShell command ""get-adgroup -identity '<samaccountname of group>' -properties sidhistory |select name,sidhistory"")
YES -> wait for the AD Sync to run (should be happening automatically every night soon)
NO -> contact Martijn Tigchelaar to ensure that the group gets imported into the Cummins domain properly
?	NO -> Ensure the user's Meritor 611 has the group membership and wait for the AD Sync to run (should be happening automatically every night soon)
o	NO -> Go back to 1) because you missed something…

Following the logic that the login script should be creating the drive mappings and that it does so depending on the user's group memberships, if the drive mappings do not get created, follow this guidance to help diagnose the issue:

1)	Was the user in the office or connected to VPN when the login script was triggered?
o	YES -> go to 2)
o	NO -> Connect to VPN and then try again
2)	Can the user manually map a drive to the shared folder?
o	YES -> it is not a permissions issue -> login script issue
Will need to be resolved by working with EUC Technical team to get login script corrected
o	NO -> Go to 3)
3)	Does the user have Cached Credentials for the PRD-domain in Credential Manager?
If so, the user may inadvertently be attempting to connect to the legacy Meritor resources with out-of-date credentials, resulting in no access.
o	YES -> Clear the credentials in credential manager -> then Go to 2)
o	NO -> Go to 4)
4)	Check the Group memberships for the user's WWID to see if it missing any memberships related to the shared folder(s) in question. Then go to 5)
This can easily be done by anyone from any EUC device using the PowerShell samples below. 

To check a user's group memberships related to the groups that belong to a specific SITE…:
(Remember – all legacy Meritor group names should be following the standard naming convention that dictates that the name of a group should start with the site-code of the facility the group belongs to…)

get-adprincipalgroupmembership -identity <wwid> |select name | Where-Object {$_.name -like '<site-code>*' }

               Example:
               get-adprincipalgroupmembership -identity us524 |select name | Where-Object {$_.name -like 'TRY*' }

               Output:
               name
----
TRY - All Users
TRYxeForms-Users
TRYxEbaseUsr
TRY - Dell Deployment Users
TRYWHQUsers
TRYxUsers
TRYxISMgtIncidentN
TRYxMeritorDC

5)	Is the user's WWID missing a group membership it should have that is related to the shared folder(s) in question?
o	YES -> Does the user's Meritor userID have the missing group membership?
?	YES ->   Does the group exist in the Cummins domain and does it have SID-History?
(this can be checked with PowerShell command ""get-adgroup -identity '<samaccountname of group>' -properties sidhistory |select name,sidhistory"")
YES -> wait for the AD Sync to run (should be happening automatically every night soon)
NO -> contact Martijn Tigchelaar to ensure that the group gets imported into the Cummins domain properly
?	NO -> Ensure the user's Meritor 611 has the group membership and wait for the AD Sync to run (should be happening automatically every night soon)
o	NO -> Go back to 1) because you missed something…

Your ticket has a subject of Application Access request: Oracle Global AFT-EBS – CDBS which is the naerpprd instance but then you also mention the AFT Instance and that is the AFTPRD instance.
We need the form filled out to be proof of what you are asking for.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Sabir is a new team member who will be doing Salesforce support.  He is replacing Bhanu who is moving on. 

They need access to the pricing folder to create offline copies of our pricing feature data to support BCP in the event of a long-term outage of Salesforce. We create a monthly extract of Options, Features, RearAdds, etc. so we could do a manual pricing transaction if the event of an emergency.

Hi Jon, 
Sorry for the delay on my response.

I'm not receiving tickets to assist with the CashPro requests, normally this is by email.  I'm still receiving some emails and I'm responding what I receive, I'm not sure if the users are contacting someone else besides me for CashPro assistance, specifically with the ID for Meritor.

For the email process, users used to send the attached form to request access and updates in CashPro, the form should indicate the type of access and accounts that they need the access to; and this form should be approved by the Director of the area that is requesting access.

I'm including @Yodir W Anahuati Cacho in this email, maybe he can better knows if there is some other person in the Treasury team helping with the CashPro requests for the Meritor ID (meritori), if not, I can help with the accesses that you need.

Best regards,
Martha

OK it sounds like this does not get done with a ticket. If I don't hear back I am going to close the tickets since cashpro support does not work out of the answers helpdesk. 
If you are aware of the people who support the application and can grant access to Daniella and Josephine please add them to the email as that is what they need. 

Thanks

Sure your team must not use them. There are several teams like that. That is not an issue. 
You used to assist with this but that is not something you still do? If that is the case do you know who currently assists users needing access to the application?

As of today, nobody had told me that I needed to attend and close tickets in Cummins Connect, and I'm not receiving any notification from the system.

In he future for these tickets do you folks have a answers queue?

Hi Angel,

I have your ticket. In the description, you noted ""We request the software to make test of communications with cdbs services."" Are you a Cummins user on a Cummins computer trying to connect to Meritor websites or services? If so, there are two things you will need:

1.	Installation of Zscaler. This allows us to move from the Cummins network to the Meritor network. You can request the software here: Zscaler Inc. Zscaler 3.6.1.26 - Answers
2.	You will need a Meritor ID to access Meritor websites or services. You can request a Meritor ID by following the attached instructions.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks!

02-27-2025 09:29:58 - Evan Magyari (Work notes)
Still awaiting user's response to confirm if they tested out their new password.

02-25-2025 09:04:44 - Evan Magyari (Work notes)
Reset user's password. Waiting to hear back from them to verify it works.

Email Subject: Lenovo Surrender - SCTASK2614627

Email Body: 
Hey John,

This may not be a question for you..

Our team somehow received a surrender request through ServiceNow for a Lenovo, which I assume belongs to CDBS/Meritor.

Serial #: pf40ktps
tryfergusk1t14

It appears the user Kyle Ferguson vi189 is home based out of Indianapolis.

However, the address listed on the request is:
Matt McGinn
43813 Calle Balmez
Temecula, CA 92592

Question - Do you want us to transfer this request to your team (if so, please let me know the queue) - or should we cancel the request and advise the user somehow? (if so, please let me know how to advise).'

Appreciate your help - or you directing me appropriately. Thank you!

Hi Roksana,

Thank you for confirming the Oracle link.

The Meritor ID is the 6-1-1 ID that you described (like letkier for you). However, with Cummins employees that are being brought into the Meritor system, some IDs are being created to match their WWID so they don't have to remember a separate ID. Regardless, Nahi is not in the Meritor system. He needs to be onboarded by your HR department to have a Meritor ID created for him.

Now, to answer your other concern, Hans Gijsberts IS in the Meritor system. His ID is GIJSBEH. The reason I couldn't find him was because all I was given was his first name and his WWID, not his last name or Meritor ID. His WWID is not in active directory and there were 47 people that came up for ""Hans."" I will be able to mirror Nahi's Oracle access after Hans' access once Nahi is in the Meritor system. The process isn't difficult, it just needs to be done in the proper order. I can hold on to this ticket and process it once Nahi is in our system.

Thanks!

Hi Donald,

Link is correct, as advised before.

Nahi is new to Meritor, now part of CDBS. I'm not sure what is the Meritor ID you are referring to. Is the first 6 letters of surname and 1 letter of first name? Ie, is my Meritor ID letkier? Hans Gijsberts has been with Meritor for many years, so again I do not understand why you can't find him and why it is so difficult for Nahi to obtain access to Oracle which he needs for his job. How do we obtain Meritor ID?

@Michael Payne are you able to help please?

Hello,

Just to verify, Nahi is wanting access to the Oracle instance of AFTPRD for Meritor located at https://aft-ebsprd.meritor.com, correct?

I do not see a Meritor ID for Nahi in the Meritor active directory system. If he already has a Meritor ID, please provide it. If he's new to the Meritor side, he would need to be onboarded so that ID can be created. That would be done through your HR. We can mirror his access from another account, but the account that was referenced for Hans(?) of uy541 is not in our system either.

Please advise.

Hello,
I process axle and transfer case application approval requests through the CDBS application sharepoint using the Meritor PRD\ domain.
Application website:  https://i.meritor.com/sites/Engineering/CAA/SitePages/CAASpec.aspx

On Thursday, 05/08, I was able to access the application requests that were uploaded no problem. On Friday, 05/09, I changed my Meritor password (while working remote) and since then, I have not been able to open requests. I receive the following message:

ACCESS DENIED:
You do not have access to view this file. Would you like to request for permission on SharePoint?

I worked with the applications group on getting my PRD\ and CED\ added again, but it still gives the error.

This needs to get resolved ASAP in order to perform my day-to-day duties.","global","/","05-12-2025 06:47:52","0","","","SCTASK2634684","false","Normal","05-12-2025 06:47:52","Corporate IT - Web Support - EBU Global Engineering","904",,,,"","","","Application Access Request","false","US.TRO.2135WMR","true","Modified","05-12-2025 06:47:52","Frank Harris","","","Corporate IT - Web Support - EBU Global Engineering","RITM2970689","","0","Pending Customer Inputs","CBS IT - Service Desk - English","false","","false","2","Self-service","","","","UNKNOWN","","","","","Access","","Catalog Task","","","0","","","","05-13-2025 08:16:06","vo520","9","Proceed to Next Task","Cancel all future Tasks","","","","","","","05-13-2025 06:48:04 - Varsha Meharshi (Work notes)
